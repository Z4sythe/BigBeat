# bigbeat

BigBeat is a quick way to throw together some fire beats with some sick visualizations. Channel your inner producer with this easy-to-use interface for non-stop music creation.

bigbeat.pde is the main program that controls the music and visualizations.

bars.pde, circle.pde, and square.pde are individual components of the visualization.

MusicPlayer.pde is a class that plays the music in a separate thread so that the music and the GUI can be run concurrently.

gui.pde controls the elements of the GUI using different elements of G4P's library.

The data folder contains sound files that can be edited to include a different set of sounds.
